# Agora: Mossland DAO Governance Framework

Welcome to Agora, the cornerstone of transparent governance for the Mossland DAO. Agora is a decentralized governance framework designed to empower various members of the Mossland community to actively participate in the decision-making processes. Through Agora, we uphold the values of openness, collaboration, and innovation that are central to the Mossland ecosystem.

# Purpose
Agora serves as the democratic heart of Mossland DAO, offering a platform for members to propose, discuss, and vote on key decisions. Our goal is to ensure that every voice within the community is heard and has the power to shape the future of Mossland.

# Key Features(TBD) 
Transparent Voting System: At Agora, every vote counts. Our transparent voting mechanism ensures that all decisions are made fairly, reflecting the collective will of the Mossland community.

Governance and Proposal Process: Agora simplifies the proposal process, making it easy for members to put forward their ideas and initiatives. Whether it's about fund allocation, project direction, or community events, Agora is the place to shape the future of Mossland.

Community-Centric Approach: We believe in the power of community. Agora is not just a governance tool; it's a platform for discussion, debate, and collaboration. Every member has the opportunity to contribute, comment, and influence the course of the DAO.

# Repository Access and Collaboration

# Milestone #1(2024/1/16-2024/2/15)

For Milestone #1, our focus is to develop a comprehensive Product Requirement Document (PRD) that encapsulates the following key features:

1. Membership and Access Rights Management.
2. DAO-Based Governance System implemented through Agora, including a robust Proposal and Voting System.
3. Considering integration with existing voting mechanisms in the Mossland Metaverse.
4. Forum-style communication channels within DAO.

## Expected deliverables

Additionally, we will provide:

A detailed user flow of the product, mapping out the interaction pathways for different user types.
A fully designed high-fidelity (HiFi) design of the product interface, presented in Figma format. This design will encompass all user interface elements, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.
In terms of research and development strategy, we will:

- Engage in ideation sessions to brainstorm and refine our concepts, ensuring that our solutions are innovative and user-centric.
- Conduct product dogfooding to internally test and iterate our product, gaining firsthand experience of its functionality and user interface.
- Perform desk research to gather references and insights. This will involve analyzing existing solutions and best practices in similar domains, helping us to inform our design and functional decisions with industry standards and user expectations.
These tasks aim to lay a solid foundation for the Agora project, ensuring that we deliver a product that is not only technically robust but also user-friendly and aligned with the Mossland community's needs.

## Week 4(2/7~2/16)
0207 추가 코멘트 
어드민 화면 요구사항 주신 것 바탕으로 기능 명세 필요 -> 디자인 플로우에 반영 예정
현 lofi 기준으로 자잘한 수정사항 업데이트는 계속 진행 중입니다
웹앱 기준으로 고려했어서, 웹 기준으로 디자인을 진행했는데 반응형에 따라 모바일 화면 대응은 이번 스콥에서는 어려울 것 같습니다. 웹 디자인 시 각 섹션을 모듈로 제작하긴 했어서 모바일은 스콥 확정 후, phase 2에 project showcase 등 추가되는 화면들 포함해서 같이 대응할 수 있도록 할게요. (사실 웹 dapp 중에 모바일 까지 뎁스있게 대응하는 경우가 많지는 않아서, 저희도 mossverse 에서는 웹으로 띄울거고, agora 단독으로 이용 하는 시나리오 정도 고려되는데, 해당 부분은 우선순위를 살짝 조정하도록 하겠습니다
